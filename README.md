# VSCode + Flatpak integration

A very simple VSCode extension that detects a Flatpak manifest and offers various commands to build, run & export a bundle.

## Download

- [Microsoft Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bilelmoussaoui.flatpak-vscode)
- [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/bilelmoussaoui/flatpak-vscode)

## Requirements

- `flatpak`
- `flatpak-builder`

  if you're using Fedora Silverblue, you will have to layer `flatpak-builder` as it is no longer part of the base image. You can use something like `rpm-ostree install flatpak-builder`

## Commands

- Build: Initialize a Flatpak build, update the dependencies & build them. It also does a first build of the application.
- Rebuild: Rebuild the application and triggers a "Run" command.
- Stop: Stop the currently running task.
- Run: Run the application
- Update Dependencies: Download/Update the dependencies and builds them.
- Clean: Clean the Flatpak repo directory (`.flatpak/repo`) inside the current workspace.
- Runtime Terminal: Spawn a new terminal inside the specified SDK.
- Build Terminal: Spawn a new terminal inside the current build repository (Note that the SDKs used are automatically mounted and enabled as well).
- Show Output Terminal: Show the output terminal of the build and run commands.
- Select Manifest: Change the active manifest.

## Integrations

Other extensions like `rust-analyzer` and `vala` mostly works better if it integrates with the
Flatpak runtime. Some integrations may prevent rebuilds or requiring to install dependencies in
the host. If you want to contribute on adding an integration, see [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md).

### [Meson Build](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mesonbuild.mesonbuild)

- Overrides `mesonbuild.configureOnOpen` to not ask to configure the build directory; this should be handled by Flatpak.
- Overrides `mesonbuild.buildFolder` to use the build directory used by Flatpak.
- Overrides `mesonbuild.mesonPath` to use the meson binary from the SDK.

### [Rust Analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=matklad.rust-analyzer)

- Overrides `rust-analyzer.server.path` to use the SDK's rust-analyzer and `rust-analyzer.runnables.overrideCargo` to use the SDK's cargo. This make sures that rust-analyzer and cargo uses package from the runtime instead of the host packages.
- Overrides `rust-analyzer.runnables.cargoExtraArgs` to set cargo's `--target-dir` to `_build/src`. Identical target dir must be set on your build system to prevent rebuilding when running rust-analyzer runnables.
- Overrides `rust-analyzer.files.excludeDirs` to set rust-analyzer to ignore `.flatpak` folder.

### [Vala](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=prince781.vala)

- Overrides `vls.languageServerPath` to use the SDK's vls.
